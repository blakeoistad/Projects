# iRogan 
## Podcast Player for The Joe Rogan Experience 

### Concept 
• The iOS Podcast app is great for hosting so many podcast shows, but it is simply not very user friendly and doesn't allow for individual podcasts to have any customization or special features. iRogan allows you to browse and listen to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast in a clean, simple, and searchable way without distraction or unnecessary overhead. <br>

### Technologies and Frameworks 
• Utilized AVFoundation framework and AVPlayer for audio playback <br>
• Used NSXMLParser to parse through Joe Rogan's LibsynPro RSS Feed, used delegate methods to clean and filter data <br>
• Utilized Core Data to save parsed feed information to improve app loading time and network useage, as well as save track progression

### Contributing 
• If you like iRogan and want to help me continue development, please ★ the repo! <br>

### Possible Future Features
• Allow for creation of a user-saved playist of epiosdes <br>
• Allow for tracking of up to possibly 10 recently played epiosdes <br>
• Create a unique user interface for iPad version <br>
• Looking into expanding project to Android
